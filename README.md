# NEO-NOIR
A noir text-adventure created for a school assignment.

## Where did the inspiration come from?
I'm a big fan of the Noir and Cyberpunk genre's respectively.
Once they come together they create a perfect genre. I wanted to add
something to a genre that I love and I want to continue working on this.
